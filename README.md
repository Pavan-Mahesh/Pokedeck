# 📖 PokeDeck

A modern **Pokédex-inspired web application** built with **React + Tailwind CSS**, powered by the amazing [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

Every kid who watched Pokémon dreamed of having a Pokédex just like in the anime. I’m no kid anymore 😅, so I decided to build one — for the kids (and adults) who still want to browse, search, and explore the Pokémon universe in a fun and modern way!

## ✨ Features
